# my-game

## Overview

This project is the developer's first attempt at making a video game and will be using the Godot engine. The basic concept is a maze-like game with enemies and other Roguelike elements, but this is subject to change. More details about the scope of the game and planned features can be found in the wiki.

The game is currently in the early stages of development. The project's name will be changed when the scope is better understood.


## Installation

To develop or playtest the game, you will need to download and install the [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/download), available on Linux, Windows, or OS X. Then, import the game folder into Godot (drag-and-drop is supported).


## Gameplay
